# Given a number n, determine whether it is a prime number or not. A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

# Examples :

# Input: n = 7
# Output: true
# Explanation: 7 has exactly two divisors: 1 and 7, making it a prime number.
# Input: n = 25
# Output: false
# Explanation: 25 has more than two divisors: 1, 5, and 25, so it is not a prime number.
# Input: n = 1
# Output: false
# Explanation: 1 has only one divisor (1 itself), which is not sufficient for it to be considered prime.
# Constraints:
# 1 ≤ n ≤ 109

# Solution
from math import sqrt 
class Solution:
    def isPrime(self, n):
        # code here
        if (n<=1):
            return  False
        for i in range(2, int(sqrt(n)) + 1):
            if n%i==0:
                return False
        return True
