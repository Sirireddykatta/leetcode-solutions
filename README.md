# Problem-Solving Repository

Welcome to my repository of coding solutions! This collection contains my solutions to problems from platforms like **LeetCode** and **GeeksforGeeks**, implemented in Python (and other languages as I explore them). I solve problems daily, and this repository will be updated regularly to reflect my progress.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into folders by **problem category**. Each file is named after the problem it solves, and includes:
- A brief description of the problem.
- A link to the original problem statement.
- My solution for the problem

### Current Categories
- **Arrays**
- **Strings**
- **Dynamic Programming**
- **Linked Lists**
- **Trees and Graphs**
- **Sorting and Searching**

## ðŸ“ˆ Purpose
This repository serves to:
- Track my progress in problem-solving.
- Showcase my coding skills to potential recruiters.
- Help others understand different approaches to solving popular problems.

## ðŸ”§ Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Languages**: Python (primary), Java (future solutions planned)
- **Platforms**: 
  - [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com)
  - [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org)

## How to Use
1. Navigate to the folder matching the problem category.
2. Open the file to view the solution and its explanation.
3. Use the problem link provided in the comments to review the problem description.

## Updates
I aim to solve problems daily and update this repository regularly. Check back often for new solutions!

## Acknowledgments
Special thanks to:
- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com) for providing a vast range of problems for interview prep.
